very grateful to be selected to attend three Ph.D. courses on topics that I like. Incidentally, the Professors that hold them are also leaders in their respective fields. The course content and instructors are at the forefront of science, very exciting! I have also driven for 3000 km through Italy with my motorbike to make the most of the break.
