I am a Research Intern at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/) in Prof. [Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/)'s group, focusing on Optimization! Previously, I was a Research Intern @[ENS Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en) under the supervision of [Bruno Loureiro](https://brloureiro.github.io/), exploring Stochastic Gradient Descent dynamics beyond the unstructured assumption. Last summer, I was a Research Intern @[IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/home) under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/), where I worked on Approximate Message Passing and Information Theoretic limits of a model of inference. 

I graduated with an MS in Data Science at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/master+of+science/data+science+and+business+analytics/). My supervisor was Prof. [Carlo Lucibello](https://carlolucibello.github.io/). Before my graduate studies, I completed a Bachelor in Economics and Computer Science.

- 🛠 My main research interests are **Theory of Learning** and of **Neural Networks** broadly 

- 👨‍💻 Give a look at the **writings** and **talks** sections to see what I do! 
    - **writings** hosts both long and short documents
    - most **talks** are paired with a short writing

The prompt I gave to Dall-E2 for the suprinsingly self resembling image was
>"Van Gogh style painting of an Italian boy in his 20s with a shirt and eyeglasses, brown curly hair, brown eyes"

Perharps I am a ground state of some Open AI's ML pipeline...
