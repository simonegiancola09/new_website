The internship was a summer gig and in October I will join another lab.</p>

<p>Wien is a wonderful place. I do not think I have lived in enought cities to develop a wise judgement, but I can safely say it has been the best one so far. In few words: it works. It’s safe, public transport is highly encouraged, life is easy and not as expensive as Milan for example. People never bother you and everyone is respectful. It’s not perfect, but nobody wants it. I highly recommend a visit.</p>

<p>In the summer (I was told the winter is kind of harder), you literally breathe life. People are out, things happen, there is in general a strong drive to enjoy what is thrown on the table. What struck me the most is the underground. Given that all citizens use it, it is some kind of open air view of the life of each resident. A TV-show with people falling in love and breaking up, happiness and sadness, very very nice. I really enjoyed this bit of my stay: where there is emotions there is wellness and humanity over all, believe it or not.</p>

<p>Getting to my job at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (in short ISTA), it has been wonderful. A very nice place, awesome people, and a solid expansion project. I am not an expert of research environments, but I could feel that there is some long-term project in the institution that goes well beyond my stay or everyone else’s. 
I have deeply enjoyed challenging myself in conducting research, and am now more than ever convinced to pursue a research career. This was never in doubt, but somehow every experience gives me more and more motivation.</p>

<p>Thank you IST, Thank you to the organizers of the internship. Thank you Marco, you have been a great supervisor, and your topics of research are very cool. Thank you to the whole group for being nice, for hosting me and teaching me every day something new. I will do my best to see you again sometime somewhere.</p>

<p>To anyone reading this, if you have the opportunity to spend some time in Wien or do research at IST, please go!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="nontheory" /><category term="research" /><category term="life" /><category term="europe" /><category term="opinions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A wrap-up of my three months in Austria]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A list of lists of interesting things</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/list-of-interesting-things/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A list of lists of interesting things" /><published>2023-07-23T23:01:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-07-23T23:01:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/list-of-interesting-things</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/list-of-interesting-things/"><![CDATA[<p>Below is a list of things that I enjoyed throughout the years, as the memory comes and goes I will update it.

Senza differenze, lo ha anche nel mio caso. La trovo una città molto a misura di persona, nonostante le forti critiche che subisce. Al contrario, non sono convinto che una vita passata a Milano sia effettivamente desiderabile, anche per la mente più particolare.</p>

<p>In fin dei conti, stiamo confrontando inquinamento stress e tempo a dire poco penoso con bellezza, apoteosi della dolce vita e quieto vivere. Una prova tangibile di questo fatto è la stessa ambientazione di buona parte dei film italiani, di cui sono particolarmente appassionato. Raramente (per quanto riguarda quelli che apprezzo, mai) l’ambientazione, immaginaria o dichiarata che sia, ricorda quella del capoluogo lombardo. Nella maggior parte dei casi risulta invece essere uno spaccato di vita di cittadini della capitale.</p>

<p>La lista di film che segue raccoglie questo significato. Raccoglie l’Italia che tutti vorrebbero vivere, e le trame che tutti vorrebbero sperimentare. Non nascondo che alcuni siano forse troppo smielati a prima vista per il pubblico medio, ma spesso nascondono significati ben più profondi di quello che si possa pensare.</p>

<p>Data la memoria imperfetta, sarà una lista soggetta a continuo aggiustamento, così come sarà aggiornata con nuove pellicole che ancora mancano. La suddivisione è per attori / registi senza molta logica.</p>

In parallel, I will comment on
the last 12 months, since they have been the clearest example of <em>the importance of having a Mission</em>. Despite being 100% sure that I
am not a person able to give advice, you might pick up something in the end.</p>

<h3 id="why-such-a-corny-title">Why such a corny title?</h3>
<p>Being a huge hater of wrongfully formulated titles, I need to explain this in two or three sentences. For me, <em>having a Mission</em> means waking up with
a purpose. Such purpose is <em>purposely</em> not specified. It might be a career objective, a self-care target, a desire to provide for someone else (e.g. family).
Even a mix of these things is fine. Empirically, it just so happens that I can only focus on one, but maybe that is only my impression, or
self-infliction of a famous Italian belief that only women can do more than one thing at a time. Despite seeming itself corny as an explanation, if you actually 
think about it, you are only able to <strong>do</strong> something when it falls inside some big picture of yours where everything works out in the end.</p>

<p>Why would someone study, work, have a shower, cook, do anything at all if there is not some immediate and expected-long-term enjoyment?</p>

<p>It is also more or less true for myself that such Mission works best when designed to benefit someone else. While I do not expect this to hold in general, I will elaborate further in the paragraphs below.</p>

<h3 id="isnt-it-just-the-way-it-is">Isn’t it just the way it is?</h3>
<p>Well, yes and no. From the height of my 23 years of life (yes, I am consciously being ironic), I came to understand that focusing is something I need to impose to myself, rather than just independently going on. I have spent many years trying to follow my default desires, without structure, just to find out that planning is far more effective and helps you get what you want. Last year has been the uttermost achievement in this sense. I have found tranquility and happiness in pursuing a long-term dream that brought me to plenty short-term wonderful experiences.</p>

<h3 id="march-2022---march-2023">March 2022 - March 2023</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this period, I simply chose to follow an idea that seemed reasonable and fun enough. Despite not being my final desire for the future, which I guess for everyone is just to be happy and fulfilled, it is certainly what brings me the closest to it. After years of study, I decided to start the process of willingly attempting to pursue an academic career. This is not at all a finished task, and it might be never fulfilled, but it has been pivotal in these 365 days. There are two main reasons. First of all, it is something I enjoy, as much as very few other things in life. Secondly, it is an expression of willingness to do good for society. The side effects of this plan have been fantastic.</p>

<p>Gaslighted by it, I have thrived socially, as a person, and mentally, in contexts unrelated to performing scientific research. My belief is that it is due to the fact that I more or less found my way, and that the consciouness of it being useful for the community has in some sense let me be happier for myself.</p>

<h3 id="the-fil-rouge">The <em>fil rouge</em></h3>
<p>If you feel like your way was not found yet, what I observed in people that give the impression of being <em>on a Mission</em> (mine is just a copying mechanism), is that all of them are eventually based on love. Be it self-oriented, for the everyone else, for a specific community, in the end it is all the same. The
common thread is focusing on doing something good. The gains come later, almost instantly, and are often never forgotten.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, I see many peers struggling in this. My opinion is that it is better to focus on a stupid mission rather than ignoring the issue in its entirety. The main reason is that without an objective, you have no identity, and without an identity, you will lose yourself. Oftentimes, it happens that this elightenment must come from someone else in your life. In my case, this is true more than ever. I started understanding how to be happy when I found out that I must look further than below my nose, since people around me are the easiest example of how life can go on, especially when yours is not at all going.</p>

<h3 id="when-are-the-results-coming">When are the results coming?</h3>
<p>Aware that this is a topic impossible not to care about, my guess is <strong>instantly</strong>. Despite having set such a foggy and not at all straight objective, the path that I am following has lead to many side results, sometimes completely unrelated, that have kept me going, and will keep me going. I have enjoyed studying and getting good grades, but I also had the privilege of cultivating strong friendships along the way, finding an inner balance, and having probably the best fun of my life. Even though last year I wrote almost 1000 computer-typed and countless (approx. 4000) handwritten pages of mathematics, 
I somehow found more time to hang out, bond, have holidays, party, work, think. All of this is thanks to waking up with already half of the work done (i.e. knowing what to wish for). No agenda planning, no specific tasks, no pressure, just knocking at every door possibly linked to what I wanted to do.</p>

<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>My guess is that I will go on, and just see what happens. There are expectations, but even if something will not work out, there is always love on the backline (again, not in the corny sense of the word), so I <strong>will</strong> be fine. A mission never dies, it just keeps on stimulating your self-development, and that is probably what makes it even better.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="nontheory" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="informal" /><category term="goodthings" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A wrap up of thoughts]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rules of the game</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/rules-of-the-game/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rules of the game" /><published>2023-04-01T23:01:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-04-01T23:01:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/rules-of-the-game</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/rules-of-the-game/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="some-boring-introduction">Some Boring introduction</h2>
<p>This is my first attempt at writing a blog. Despite being strange, and kind of old-fashioned, it might actually be fun so I thought of giving it a try.</p>

<p>I still do not know if this will be a fixed activity, or more influenced by randomness, and what I will talk about. Short term topics are likely to be a mix of Mathematics, music, films, and socially felt problems. My guess is that I will talk a bit about what I am studying at the moment, and occasionally use some posts to talk about non work related topics. The general aim is collecting thoughts to see what changes in years in terms of <em>writing</em>, <em>thinking</em> and <em>seeing</em>.</p>

<h2 id="content-delivery">Content Delivery</h2>
<p>Concerning non Science related subjects, I would like this to be a free area in which I can type down whatever comes to my mind. Respect will be always kept, but please keep in mind that as Twitter users state in their bio: “opinions are my own”.</p>

<p>I guarantee you that I will not be as hard as one of my favourite radio programs, “La Zanzara” on Radio24, but at the same time not as soft as national television. I feel like one of the most important things in life are discussion and developing ideas, and a blog looks like a perfect fit for both.</p>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>

<p>The impression is that I am bad at writing in both English and Italian, the only two languages I known enough to even formulate more than 3 sentences. I might alternate between the two indefinitely, but will point out when a post is in my native language. It is hihgly likely that academic and life matters will be repsectively in English and Italian, with occasional crossover English posts when talking about international topics that are non technical.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><category term="metablogging" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blog presentation]]></summary></entry></feed>
