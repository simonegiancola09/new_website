I have recently finished my wonderful stay at École Normale Supérieure. It has been a busy three months, of which I am very grateful. The city is a beautiful mess, and literally never sleeps. People on the undergound grind their whole trip to work at any time of the day, as I did. On the relax side, the __Parisien__ know well when to rest. It looks like everyone is aware of the toll that the city places upon its citizens, something that I did not really understand the first month. 

Despite this, I have been supported by wonderful people, in what probably is __The__ institution for research. Without exxageration, my corridor held a portion of the best researchers in the field, as well as lots of young promising colleagues, always available to discuss and help. I can only thank everyone for their time and willingness to make me grow. 

On a very important aspect to remark, France, and especially Paris, are some of the very rare places where researchers are not only respected but protected. This is very noticeable on many aspects, from job security to freedom of research. Despite the sweet beaurocracy very akin to the Italian style, these guys do know how to keep a clever person (like the ones I was with) thrive. Their love extends so much that the most important names in science make their way to be engraved in the Eiffel Tower, which is something that amazes me to this day. Long live to this, France is a place of freedom and self-expression! I can only respect this way of thinking.
