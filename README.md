Under construction, template from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). 

Tips:
```
Change stuff

Go to vs

Change config well

Add your files

Maybe disbable imagemagick

Inside gem file, add on first line

Gem ‘wdm’, ‘>=0.1.0’

Add and comment
```
Now kind of difficult, but need to have ```rbenv``` and a nice version of Ruby installed (I use 3.2.2). Likely, it will not be activated, but it suffices to call:
```
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"
rbenv local 3.2.2
```
to be able to work with the other commands
```

Run on terminal bundle install 

Bundle exec jekyll serve 

Copy server address and paste into browser

Check change
```
once finished commit
```
Once finished commit

Call bin/deploy —user 

Proceed
```

AAAA
