"To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish","Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977), in ""The Great Dictator""",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Charlie_Chaplin.jpg/640px-Charlie_Chaplin.jpg,Wikipedia

"The law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme position among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's equations - then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations. If it is found to be contradicted by observation - well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to be against the Second Law of Thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it to collapse in deepest humiliation.",Arthur Eddington (1882 – 1944),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_Stanley_Eddington.jpg,Wikipedia
