## Synopsis

We discuss recent results on the problem of balancing random matrices. The origin is
from its deterministic version, one of the most important open questions in discrepancy
theory. The first part is a walk through of a very recent paper (Maillard 2024), emphasizing
its contribution. Then, drawing up on the final comments of the results, we analyze the
geometry of solutions, i.e. how the balancing points are arranged in space. We do this
through a companion model that was the main object of the analysis for the analog vector
problem. For a specific design, we find that solutions are isolated, meaning that at least
â„¦(n) signs have to change to hop from one to the other. This suggests that starting from
a solution it is polynomially hopeless to find another.
